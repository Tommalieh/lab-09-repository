## Getting Started

1. Build a local Server with proper dependencies and routes and getting it to live state.
2. Get the right data from an API using the superagent library and pass it in the right form using a constructor to the right route response.
3. Make the server handle various routes with proper respones depending on the requests.
4. Store the response data from the API into it's entity inside the table related to it in the database (PGSQL).
5. If the user enter a city requested before then respond with data stored in the database without hitting the API.
